# dio-reactor-project

This is a simple Java project to test and learn reactive concepts from Project Reactor.

In the main method I test different uses of [Mono](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html) and [Flux](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html) illustrating how they work.

## How to run the project ?

```sh
./mvnw exec:java
```
